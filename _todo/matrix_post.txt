1. vector-vector inner and outter production. 
2. matrix-vector production, matrix-matrix production, different representation(inner and outter)
3. intuition of the matrix determinant.
4. intuition of the matrix transpose. (use SVD to show the relatioship between A transpose and A inverse)
5. (optional) change of basis.
6. Geometric intuition of eigenvalue and eigenvector, and determinant.
- eigenvalue of a matrix represents how much the matrix scales the space along the corresponding eigenvector.
- determinant of a matrix denotes how much the matrix scales a geometric shape (combine all directions).
  e.g. 2D is area and 3D is the volumn.
$\det(A) = \product \lambda_{i}$


- Matrix A defines a vector space. By definition, $A v = \lambda v$, $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $v$ is the corresponding eigenvector.
  Geometricly, it says, for some $v$ applying matrix transformation (rotation, scale) is equivalent to scale the $v$ by \lambda.
  If we can select linearly independent eigenvectors to span the same vector space defined by matrix A, those selected eigenvectors
  can be used as basis vectors and the basis is called eigenbasis. For any vector $v$ in the standard space, represent it with respect
  to eigenbasis $E^{-1} v$, apply matrix transformation A to any vector in the standard space, is eigenvalue to applying $\lambda I$ to
  its eigenbasis representation $E^{-1} v$. $\lambda I$ only does scaling. In factor, by converting $v$ from standard basis to eigenbasis,
  we simplify the matrix transformation (rotation and scaling) to just scaling!
  Some complex/expensive operation in one vector basis could be simplify by transform vectors to different basis.
  e.g. $A^100$ (rotation + scaling) to vectors represent using standard basis, could be as simple as applying $\lambda^n I$ to vectors
  represented using eigenbasis.
