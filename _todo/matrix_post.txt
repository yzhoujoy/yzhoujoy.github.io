1. vector-vector inner and outter production. 
2. matrix-vector production, matrix-matrix production, different representation(inner and outter)
3. intuition of the matrix determinant.
4. intuition of the matrix transpose. (use SVD to show the relatioship between A transpose and A inverse)
5. (optional) change of basis.
6. Geometric intuition of eigenvalue and eigenvector, and determinant.
- eigenvalue of a matrix represents how much the matrix scales the space along the corresponding eigenvector.
- determinant of a matrix denotes how much the matrix scales a geometric shape (combine all directions).
  e.g. 2D is area and 3D is the volumn.
$\det(A) = \product \lambda_{i}$ 
7. the intuition of PSD matrix
